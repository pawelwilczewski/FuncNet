## Core Operating Principles

1. **Instruction Reception and Understanding**
    - Carefully read and interpret user instructions
    - Ask specific questions when clarification is needed
    - Clearly identify technical constraints and requirements
    - Do not perform any operations beyond what is instructed

2. **Commenting**
    - Never put comments in the code except when strictly useful
    - Code should be fully understandable and clear without need of any comments

3. **Implementation Planning**
    ```markdown
    ## Implementation Plan
    1. [Specific step 1]
        - Detailed implementation content
        - Expected challenges and countermeasures
    2. [Specific step 2]
        ...
    ```

4. **Comprehensive Implementation and Verification**
    - Before committing to an implementation, consider its impacts and carefully weigh different options
    - Execute file operations and related processes in optimized complete sequences
    - Continuously verify against quality standards throughout implementation
    - Address issues promptly with integrated solutions
    - Execute processes only within the scope of instructions, without adding extra features or operations

5. **Continuous Feedback**
    - Regularly report implementation progress
    - Confirm at critical decision points
    - Promptly report issues with proposed solutions

## Quality Management Protocol
### 1. Code Quality
    - Follow Domain Driven Design principles
    - Always prefer Linq and declarative code over imperative
    - Prefer functional style implementations with body expressions
    - Never multiple enumerate an `IEnumerable<>`
### 2. Performance
    - Avoid unnecessary materialization like `ToList()`, `ToArray()`
### 3. Security
    - Strict input validation
    - Appropriate error handling
    - Secure management of sensitive information
### 3. Code style
    - Strictly obey code style present in project/file modified    

## Implementation Process
### 1. Initial Analysis Phase
    ```markdown
    ### Requirements Analysis
        - Identify functional requirements
        - Confirm technical constraints
        - Check consistency with existing code
    ### Risk Assessment
        - Potential technical challenges
        - Performance impacts
        - Security risks
    ```
### 2. Implementation Phase
    - Integrated implementation approach
    - Continuous verification
    - Maintenance of code quality
### 3. Verification Phase
    - Unit testing
    - If exists and requested specifically: integration testing
### 4. Final Confirmation
    - Consistency with requirements
    - Code quality

## Error Handling Protocol
1. **Problem Identification**
   - Error message analysis
   - Impact scope identification
   - Root cause isolation
2. **Solution Development**
   - Evaluation of multiple approaches
   - Risk assessment
   - Optimal solution selection
3. **Implementation and Verification**
   - Solution implementation
   - Verification through testing
   - Side effect confirmation
4. **Documentation**
   - Record of problem and solution
   - Preventive measure proposals
   - Sharing of learning points

## Namespaces
    - Use file-scoped namespaces that match the folder structure.

## Immutability
    - Prefer immutable types unless mutability is requested.
    - Prefer records over classes for immutable types.

## Files Organization
    - Define one type per file.

## Record Design
    - Define record's properties on the same line with the record declaration.
    - Use immutable collections in records unless requested otherwise.
    - Use `ImmutableList<T>` in records whenever possible.

I will follow these instructions to deliver high-quality implementations. I will only perform operations within the scope of the instructions provided and will not add unnecessary implementations. For any unclear points or when important decisions are needed, I will seek confirmation.
